# EcoQuery Chrome Extension Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 21, 2025**

## Overview
EcoQuery is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information when you use our environmental impact comparison tool.

## Information We Do NOT Collect
EcoQuery does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information, including but not limited to:
- Your search queries or ChatGPT conversations
- Personal identification information (name, email, address)
- Browsing history or website data
- Location information
- Authentication credentials
- Any other personal or sensitive data

## How EcoQuery Works
EcoQuery operates entirely locally on your device to:
- **Analyze query text**: We examine the text you type for complexity scoring (word count, keywords) to estimate environmental impact
- **Calculate environmental estimates**: We perform mathematical calculations using research-based energy models
- **Display comparison information**: We show you the calculated environmental impact in a popup interface
- **Route your queries**: When you choose "Use Google," we redirect your query to Google Search; when you choose "Use ChatGPT," we allow your original query to proceed

**Important**: All processing happens locally in your browser. No data leaves your device.

## Third-Party Services
When you choose to use Google Search through our extension, you will be subject to Google's own privacy policy and terms of service. EcoQuery does not control or monitor your interactions with external services.

## Data Security
Since we don't collect any data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised through our extension. All calculations and processing occur locally on your device.

## Permissions Explanation
EcoQuery requires the following permissions solely for its core functionality:
- **Access to ChatGPT websites**: To intercept queries and display environmental impact comparisons
- **Content script injection**: To create the comparison popup interface

These permissions are used exclusively for the extension's stated purpose and not for data collection.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted with an updated effective date. Continued use of EcoQuery after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
